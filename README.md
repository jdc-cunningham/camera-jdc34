#### About the name
The name is my name but also it's 3 c's (including the word camera) and the camera number. Yeah I do have other camera bodies I want to design and make. One would be based on the ESP32 ecosystem, means lower resolution but yeah.

I haven't thought of an actual name for this camera so... I figure I'd just use numbers.
