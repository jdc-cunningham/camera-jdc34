I feel like I'm being bad by not following through with my projects. I was supposed to design the dead space 3 scavenger robot and make it/paint it but I didn't get around to it.

I kind of lost the drive after a while. I will complete it at some point, I'm feeling interest in making this camera instead though even though outside it's winter so everything is brown and dead here in the midwest.

I started buying a bunch of parts, I'm looking at wide angle lenses next to try.

I'm also looking into tuning the camera for the Minolta 50mm F1.7

Did a base design, ordered the sea-green filament
