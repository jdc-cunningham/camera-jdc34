### Disclaimer

Please note: the front shell needs some corrections, I'll remove this message once I have made the changes. In general this mesh is messed up, I did the modeling in SketchUp and it has problems with solids.

The specific problems:
- HQ mount pegs are wrong, don't match, so I just hot-glued the HQ cam to the body which is not bad since you're going to attach
- the bottom-left mount for the RPi 4B is not actually attached when it prints which is weird
- the screw mounts that hold the two halves together are too small/frail, be careful, I snapped one of them on accident and had to print this A-shape thing to go around the broken screw mount
- the charger holder is bad, I need to make that be two ends and as L shape, no support in between that is hard to take out, the problem is the charger gets hot, hot enough to re-melt hot glue
- the back-button on the back shell, is not designed right, needs to be a square

While not intentional, it's tight to close the screen, since the hinge doesn't have any resistance, it just follows gravity. Currently the scringe hinge as is works well for pushing it in/keeping it closed.
