### Disclaimer

Please note: the front shell needs some corrections, I'll remove this message once I have made the changes. In general this mesh is messed up, I did the modeling in SketchUp and it has problems with solids. Refer to design flaws file.

While not intentional, it's tight to close the screen, since the hinge doesn't have any resistance, it just follows gravity. Currently the scringe hinge as is works well for pushing it in/keeping it closed.

I did fix the OLED cutout, it was too big for my taste, and I just printed a small wedge and superglued it on mine. But you can see if you print this as is you will get a usable body.
